# let's get into it

A spectre is haunting europe, the spectre of mandatory sim-card registration. Against popular belief, this is not the work of our friends in Belgium, but rather every european state
shares the same paranoia and compulsory urge to surveil their citizens even more. Even better: The EU came to the [conclusion](https://netzpolitik.org/2013/vorratsdatenspeicherung-eu-kommission-legt-beweise-fuer-notwendigkeit-vor-beweist-aber-die-notwendigkeit-nicht/) that sim-card registrations do **not** help with combating crime, terrorism or other illegal activities. But the member states obviously don't care.

# so, how do we work around this bullshit?

The first thing that comes to mind is *buying a card in one of the remaining member states, that do not require ID*. So far so good.
Question is: which states are not affected yet?
Only few remain. E.g Serbia, Croatia and probably some other balkan states.
